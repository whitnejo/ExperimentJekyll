Some times it is fun to think about the way things are. Why did this world come out the way it did? I don't think there is any one divine creator. We are all connected to each other through the field of energy that is always running through us. There are microwaves, wi-fi signals, cell signals and other natural phenomenon going on all the time. We are made of energy too. Each of us is made of molecules that are always vibrating.

Those who subscribe to the Law of Attraction say that we can use this to our advantage. We can change our vibration to match that which we wish we had. I wonder if it is closer to faking it to make it. What makes you vibe most of what you want than actually going out and doing it? Actually going out there and doing it. What is the outcome of actually doing out and doing it. You get it! Funny that.

You know either way tho. The "Universe" is much smarter than I'll ever be. It can do things how it chooses.
